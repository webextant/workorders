* Improvement: Adjusting links to large buttons pageindex.php 
* Improvement: Removed listing of all work orders for every user pageindex.php
* Security: Applied user permissions pageindex.php
* Improvement: Added functions to WorkorderDataAdapter Class to handle custom queries.
 * This is for user-based / permission-based queries of workorders
 * Users can see their own work orders and status
 * Approvers can see items that need approval with links
* Improvement: Began adding new encryption script. navbar.php
* Improvement: index.php - Instead of including includes/home.php I now just incluce _page_processor.php
 * This file includes several references including the new 
   * dbquery
     * dbquery/QUERY_PROCESS
     * dbquery/QUERY_PROCESS_SUB
   * /page_content/index.php
   * /page_content/header.php
* Security: appconfig.php - add the encrypting includes here including
 * A variable named $pg_encrypt_key
 * And an includes /page_encryption.php
 * These had to be added here because of the changes I am making to the navbar.php.  Pages that did not have the new includes would break because the navbar ware looking for a function that did not exist.  By adding it here it is now being referenced on every page
* Improvement: createworkorder.php - This page is still functional but is no longer needed.  I have recreated it using the page encryption method
 * NOTE:  the page at /page_contents/WORKORDER/create.php is basically just including elements from createworkorder.php including 
  * Resources/librarty/dot.php
  * Includes/pageworkordersnew.php

**11 June 2016**

* Updated htaccess files to make php libraries inaccessible from browser.

* Added a Readme.md file

* Final approver now completes the work order and status is set to ApproveClosed.

**5 June 2016**

* Add support for user groups. Each user group can have a workflow defined within a form definition. When a new work order is created from the form definition the current users group workflow is merged with the main (district) workflow (main work flow is appended to the group workflow). This provides a way for each user group to have a group workflow that is processed before the main workflow. Since the main workflow is appended it is a global workflow (within the spcific form definition) and will be processed for all work order submissions based on the form definition.

* There are database updates that need to be applied if you have a previous install. See _update folder for details.

**16 May 2016**

* User in the approvers list who also submits work order will cause current approver to be the next approver after them in the approver list. Previous approvers are skipped since current user has approver status above previous approvers.

* The approvers update link that is generated can be viewed and allows updates without logging in. The approver key rotates for each new approver ensuring only one update per approver using the approver link.
